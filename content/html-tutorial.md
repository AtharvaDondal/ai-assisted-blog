## What is HTML?

HTML is a markup language that allows you to create structured web content. It is an essential skill for web developers.

## Setting Up the Environment

To start coding in HTML, you need a text editor and a web browser. Popular text editors include [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), and [Atom](https://atom.io/).

## Basic Syntax

HTML syntax is the set of rules that define a correctly structured HTML document. Here are some basic syntax rules:

```html
<!-- This is a comment -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Hello, World!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>

#Elements and Attributes HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
Attributes provide additional information about elements. Here is an example:
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>

#Headings Headings are used to define the headings of a page. There are six
levels of headings, from
<h1>
  to
  <h6>
    . Here is an example:
    <h1>This is a Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>This is a Heading 2</h2>

    #Paragraphs

    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

    #Lists
    <ul>
      <li>Item 1</li>
      <li>Item 2</li>
    </ul>

    #Tables

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Header 1</th>
        <th>Header 2</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Data 1</td>
        <td>Data 2</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </h6>
</h1>
```
