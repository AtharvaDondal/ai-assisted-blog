# Introduction

C++ is one of the most powerful programming languages in the world. It is primarily used for system/software development and game programming. In this tutorial, we will cover everything you need to know about C++, from the basics to advanced topics.

## What is C++?

C++ is a versatile programming language that allows you to create high-performance applications. It is an essential skill for system and game developers.

## Setting Up the Environment

To start coding in C++, you need a text editor and a compiler. Popular text editors include [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), and [Atom](https://atom.io/). Common compilers are [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) and [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/).

## Basic Syntax

C++ syntax is the set of rules that define a correctly structured C++ program. Here are some basic syntax rules:

```cpp
// This is a single-line comment
/*
  This is a multi-line comment
*/
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}

# operators
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 10, b = 20;

    // Arithmetic Operators
    cout << "a + b = " << (a + b) << endl;
    cout << "a - b = " << (a - b) << endl;

    // Relational Operators
    cout << "a == b: " << (a == b) << endl;
    cout << "a != b: " << (a != b) << endl;

    // Logical Operators
    cout << "(a < b) && (a > 5): " << ((a < b) && (a > 5)) << endl;
    cout << "(a > b) || (a < 15): " << ((a > b) || (a < 15)) << endl;

    return 0;
}

# Control Structures
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int number = 10;

    // If-Else Statement
    if (number > 0) {
        cout << "Number is positive" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Number is negative" << endl;
    }

    // For Loop
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        cout << "i: " << i << endl;
    }

    // While Loop
    int j = 0;
    while (j < 5) {
        cout << "j: " << j << endl;
        j++;
    }

    return 0;
}

```
